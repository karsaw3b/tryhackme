	Run nmap as nmap <machine Ip>
	so we see there is port 80 which webserver is running
	open Internet Browser and enter <machine IP> in the search bar
	View Page Source
	there we see a file name thm.jpg (interesying)
	download it using wget <machine IP>/thm.jpg
	its corrupted one
	open it and we see, it said header error
	open file using hexeditor (preinstalled in Linux)
	we see jpg files dont start with 0x50 0x80 
	search for jpg file signature, we get the hex code of how jpg header looks like
	replace first 12 hex code with this 'FF D8 FF E0 00 10 4A 46 49 46 00 01'
	now open the picture
	/th1s_1s_h1dd3n is the hidden directory
	now goto the hidden directory and chech page source 
	as it said its between 0 - 99
	so put this '<machine IP>/th1s_1s_h1dd3n/?secret=1'
	this worked and we cannot do this manually we can but that will take a lot of time
	so we make a python script to this automatically
	secret number is 73
	we got a password y2RPJ4QaPF!B
	this pass is used to extract hidden data from image file we download early
	if you don't have 'steghide' install, go ahead and install it using apt-get install steghide
	steghide extract -sf thm.jpg and enter the password
	we got weird looking username because this is encoded in rot13
	wbxre --> joker
	download madness photo thats shown in tryhackme room page or use this link
	wget https://i.imgur.com/5iW7kC8.jpg
	steghide extract -sf 5iW7kC8.jpg
	this does not require any password 
	and we got the password

	SSH Credentials
	username = joker
	password = *axA&GF8dP
	login using ssh joker@<machine IP> and enter password
	list file using 'ls -la', we see theres user.txt file
	cat user.txt
	and we got the flag

#2 	root.txt

	find / -type f -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \; 2>>/dev/null
	This searches for all files, owned by root, with the SUID bit set. It lists all the files that it can find, and sends error messages to /dev/null

	We will see screen-4.5.0 search for it in exploit db
	luckily we got it
	since the machine does not have any internet connection we need to copy paste the code 
	chmod the exploit file and run ./exploit.sh
	and we are root
